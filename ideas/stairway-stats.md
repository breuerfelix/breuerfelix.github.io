Introducing GreenStride, the transformative project that turns every office stairway into a hub for health and sustainability. Innovative counters installed in stairwells keep track of individuals opting for stairs over elevators. The comprehensive dashboard not only displays the calories burned by stair users but also calculates the energy savings and cost reductions from avoided elevator usage. Picture the positive impact on both employee well-being and the environment!

At the end of each month, take it a step further by directing some of these savings towards health organizations or directly benefiting office staff. GreenStride not only advocates for a healthier lifestyle but also nurtures a culture of sustainability and community giving. Join the movement in making a difference, one step at a time!
