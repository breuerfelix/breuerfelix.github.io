We just spent one night in Las Vegas to have some fun, and here are some of our learnings that we would have loved to know before we started our journey of gambling.

## Get Cash BEFORE

ATMs inside the casinos usually charge a 10% supercharge fee.
Your trip will be expensive enough without extra fees.
Better bet this money instead of paying it to some random ATM company.

## Clubbing Tickets

Research clubs, parties, or other events beforehand and try to buy tickets if they are available.
Guys typically have to spend more money on tickets than girls.
Prices also change during the evening, so buying them before your trip is always a good idea to avoid waiting for hours in line just to be broke after.

## Parking

There are flat-rate parking spots in nearly every big hotel for around 15–25 dollars per day, depending on the day of the week.
Don't forget to park in front of the hostel to unload your baggage!
It looks weird wandering around Vegas with a huge bag. Trust me, I've been through this...

## Booze

Expensive. Get drinks in a store and drink them in your room unless you want to pay 30 bucks for a Vodka Energy.

## Identity

Be prepared to show your ID card every time you want to watch or play at a table.
Everybody who looks younger than 35 will be asked for their ID.
This is a standard procedure—be prepared, just hand out your card. You'll get it back for sure!
