There is a specific bug out there, especially with HP Notebooks (440 G5).  
Sometimes `system.exe` consumes around 25% of your CPU. This is a real waste of energy so the notebook is going to consume alot of battery.

In my case the battery was fully drown after 2-3 hours. It should last around 10 hours.<!--more-->

After trying out everything, contacting the support and googling to days, I realised that the process returns normal after pressing the `search for devices` button in the Device Manager.  
Unfortunately the process starts consuming alot of cpu after a short period of time. I was tired pressing the button every 2 minutes.

I searched for a way to automate the _'clicking button x'_ process to shut `system.exe` down. There is no built in cmd command for that.  
I made up my own solution for this.

## the fix

_Note that this does not fix the problem itself. There might be a problem deep inside the software._  
_It only reduces the CPU usage back to normal by rescanning for devices every x seconds._

-   create a directory anywhere you like
-   download the correct [devcon.exe](https://superuser.com/questions/1002950/quick-method-to-install-devcon-exe) for your system
    -   click on _devcon.exe_ to see a related post
    -   rename the executeable to `devcon.exe` and place it into your new directory
-   create a file named `dev-worker.bat` in the directory
-   paste in the following content:

```powershell
@echo off
set to=30

:loop

rem moves to execution directory
cd %~dp0

rem executes devcon.exe with rescan
devcon.exe rescan

rem timeout
timeout /t %to% /nobreak

goto loop
```

Run this script **as administrator** everytime you start the Computer. It is an infinite loop as long as the computer is logged on.  
This script will rescan for new devices every 30 seconds.

## shedule the process

If you dont want to start this script everytime you log onto your computer, it's also possible to create a shedulded start for it.  
Just open the _'Sheduled Tasks'_ menue on Windows, create a new task and make sure the trigger is set to 'log on'.  
You also have to tick the checkbox _'run with high privilegies'_ to make sure it runs as administrator.

When specifying the location of the bat file, make sure to also select the directory the script should be executed in.  
This needs to be set to the directory where the `devcon.exe` file is located.
