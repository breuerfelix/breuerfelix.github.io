I recently tried to find some new interesting NeoVim plugins and realized that there are not many people blogging about their setup in 2019/2020.  
There are many outdated configs and plugin suggestions.  
I want to go through the must-have plugins (in my opinion), starting from the most important one.

__FYI__: my [dotfiles](https://github.com/breuerfelix/dotfiles) / [.vimrc](https://github.com/breuerfelix/dotfiles/blob/master/shell/.vimrc)
<!--more-->

I always try to add some sensible default configuration that I use for each plugin.

## #1 - vim-plug

We are talking about plugins here, so this one has to be rank 1.  
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) allows easy plugin management.  
I never tested others, but I also do not feel like switching because it works like a charm.

There is even an auto installation script. Just add this to the top of your `.vimrc` file.
```vim
"automated installation of vimplug if not installed
if empty(glob('~/.local/share/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim'))
    silent !curl -fLo ~/.local/share/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs
        \ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
    autocmd VimEnter * PlugInstall --sync | source ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
endif

call plug#begin('~/.config/nvim/plugged')

"plugins here, coc for example
Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim', { 'branch': 'release' }

call plug#end()
```

## #2 - Conquer of Completion

I love the intellisense from VSCode, especially if you work in big teams or continue projects after some time.  
You never remember every single variable declared back in the day.  
[CoC](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) helps you wipe out errors before they even happen.

I used [deoplete](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim), switched to [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe), tested [TabNine](https://github.com/codota/TabNine) and finally arrived at CoC.  
You don't have to take all these steps, just use it right from the start and have fun coding in Vim!

Don't forget to install the language servers you want to use (e.g., `:CocInstall coc-python`)!

```vim
Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim', { 'branch': 'release' }

inoremap <expr> <Tab> pumvisible() ? "\<C-n>" : "\<Tab>"
inoremap <expr> <S-Tab> pumvisible() ? "\<C-p>" : "\<S-Tab>"

inoremap <silent><expr> <C-space> coc#refresh()

"GoTo code navigation
nmap <leader>g <C-o>
nmap <silent> gd <Plug>(coc-definition)
nmap <silent> gt <Plug>(coc-type-definition)
nmap <silent> gi <Plug>(coc-implementation)
nmap <silent> gr <Plug>(coc-references)

nmap <leader>rn <Plug>(coc-rename)

"show all diagnostics.
nnoremap <silent> <space>d :<C-u>CocList diagnostics<cr>
"manage extensions.
nnoremap <silent> <space>e :<C-u>CocList extensions<cr>
```

## #3 - fzf

This awesome [fuzzy finder](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) lets you navigate through your project in seconds.  
I only used [NERDTree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree) in the past and also use it sometimes, but fzf boosted my file search to the moon.

After using fzf for some time, you will also notice that your file naming conventions will improve!  
The file and folder names will actually be named after what's really inside.

```bash
export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='fdfind --type f --hidden --follow --exclude .git --exclude .vim'
```

```vim
Plug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'dir': '~/.fzf', 'do': './install --all' }
Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'

map ; :Files<CR>
```

## #4 - Window splitting / movement

This is not a plugin but I use this configuration in every single Vim session.

```vim
function! WinMove(key)
    let t:curwin = winnr()
    exec "wincmd ".a:key
    if (t:curwin == winnr())
        if (match(a:key,'[jk]'))
            wincmd v
        else
            wincmd s
        endif
        exec "wincmd ".a:key
    endif
endfunction

nnoremap <silent> <C-h> :call WinMove('h')<CR>
nnoremap <silent> <C-j> :call WinMove('j')<CR>
nnoremap <silent> <C-k> :call WinMove('k')<CR>
nnoremap <silent> <C-l> :call WinMove('l')<CR>
```

It is using vim keys (for sure): `j - down / k - up / ...`  
Quick example:  
If you press `ctrl + j` and there is a pane below your pane, switch to it.  
Otherwise, create a new split pane below and switch to it.

## #5 - Auto Pairs

Probably something that you need for every single programming language.  
[Auto Pairs](https://github.com/jiangmiao/auto-pairs) just adds a closing bracket, paren, quote, or whatever you need!

It is a zero-configuration plugin and works well with [vim-sandwich](https://github.com/machakann/vim-sandwich), which I also really want to mention here.

```vim
Plug 'jiangmiao/auto-pairs'
Plug 'machakann/vim-sandwich'
```

## #6 - NERD Commenter

Sometimes you just want to comment out your new function just to check if you made a mistake or if the program was already broken before.  
Check out [this plugin](https://github.com/preservim/nerdcommenter) for language-agnostic, easy commenting of your code.

```vim
Plug 'preservim/nerdcommenter'
```

## #7 - Tabs or Spaces ?

Doesn't matter anymore! Let [vim-sleuth](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sleuth) analyze the project and decide the spacing for you.  
Just remove all your spacing settings in your `.vimrc` and this plugin will set them automatically each time you open up Vim.

This works really great with [EditorConfig](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vim). If you often work on other projects, there are plenty of different style guides.  
After using these two plugins, you don't always have to adjust your `.vimrc` each time.

```vim
Plug 'tpope/vim-sleuth'
Plug 'editorconfig/editorconfig-vim'

"example defaults for new projects
set expandtab
set tabstop=2
set shiftwidth=2
```

## #8 - gitgutter

Many people are using [fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) for managing git with Vim.  
It is a really great plugin with many features, but I like it minimalistic.

That's why I would like to show you [gitgutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter), which just displays little icons on the sidebar of each file indicating if a line is modified or added.

```vim
Plug 'airblade/vim-gitgutter'
Plug 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
```
