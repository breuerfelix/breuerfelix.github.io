## The Evolution of Keyboard Layouts

In the world of technology, advancements happen at a breakneck pace. From the early days of mechanical typing machines to the sleek and modern computer keyboards we use today, the evolution of keyboard layouts has been nothing short of remarkable. Have you ever wondered why the keys on your keyboard are staggered in the way they are? Let's delve into the history of keyboard layouts and discover why a matrix split keyboard layout might be the ergonomic solution you've been searching for.

## The Staggered Legacy

The keyboard layout as we know it today has its roots in the past. To understand its design, we need to rewind to the era of mechanical typing machines. These early contraptions couldn't be constructed with the efficient matrix layout that many contemporary split keyboards adopt. Instead, they featured a staggered arrangement of keys to prevent mechanical jams when two adjacent keys were pressed in quick succession. This legacy design persisted and was carried over to the computer keyboards we use today.

## Your Thumb Deserves Better

Take a moment to look at your keyboard. Notice how most of your fingers have a significant workload, but your poor thumbs seem to be sitting idly by, responsible for just a fraction of the action. It's a bit like sending an alpinist up Mount Everest in sneakers â€“ it's not ideal. In contrast, a split keyboard layout has at least one or two separate keys per thumb. With this layout, you can assign functions like backspace, enter, and layer switches to these additional keys. Suddenly, your thumbs, which happen to be some of the strongest fingers on your hand, find a new purpose and share the load with your other digits.

## Unleash Your Inner Beast

If you're a programmer or spend long hours at your keyboard, you're no stranger to the toll it can take on your body. Standard keyboards force you to keep your hands close together, which can lead to shoulder, back, and wrist pain over time. It's not a healthy posture for extended use. But with a split keyboard, you have the opportunity to customize your setup, allowing for a more natural hand position. The result? Reduced strain on your body and a more comfortable typing experience. It's like upgrading from sneakers to proper climbing boots for your hands.

## Future-Proofing for the Next Generation

As you evolve and adapt to ergonomic solutions like split keyboards, you may wonder why these innovative designs haven't become the norm on every desk. The answer lies in the learning curve. Mastering a new keyboard or keyboard layout isn't as simple as flipping a switch. It's a gradual process that requires reprogramming your muscle memory and forgetting the familiar layout you've used for years.

That's where the idea of teaching the next generation comes in. If you aspire to have children and want them to thrive in a more ergonomic world, consider introducing them to a human-friendly keyboard layout from the start. By doing so, you'll spare them the struggle of adapting to new layouts later in life, making their journey into the world of technology smoother and more comfortable.

In conclusion, while transitioning to a split keyboard layout might seem like a daunting task, it's an investment in your comfort and well-being. The evolution of keyboard layouts, from the days of mechanical typewriters to today's split keyboards, has been driven by a quest for ergonomics and efficiency. So, why wait? Take the plunge, embrace the matrix split keyboard layout, and unlock a more comfortable and efficient typing experience for yourself and future generations. Your thumbs will thank you.

TLDR; An alpinist does not climb the Mount Everest in sneakers. Why should you?

## Optimised for the Operator (aka. YOU)

Did you ever wonder why the keyboard layout is staggered?
It is because old mechanical typing machines couldn't be constructed with a matrix layout like most of the split keyboards have.

## Your thumb is bored

One key for two fingers? What the f* is this sh*? Your index finger should handle 6 keys but the thumb only 0.5 keys ... I don't know about this weird keyboard design.  
A split keyboard has at least one or two seperate keys per thumb. I mapped backspace, enter and a layer switch to these additional keys.  
I finally found a purpose for my thumbs (which are actually the strongest fingers on the hand)!

## You are a beast and you know it

The more muscular you become, the harder it gets to keep your hands tight together on your keyboard (for sure I don't have these kind of problems since I am a programmer.... but anyways).  
Standard keyboards generate shoulder, back and wrist pain over the years. You always have to squeeze your shoulders in front of your body together, which is not a healthy position to be in for a long period of time.  

## You want kids...

... and you want them to life in a better world, I am sure!  
"But Felix, if split keyboards are so nice, why haven't I seen them on any desk so far?"  
Good question, for sure. Learning to write on a keyboard is not as easy as you might think because you learned it as a kid or over the years. It is a slow process because it is difficult.  
Reprogramming your brain to a new keyboard or keyboard layout is even more difficult since before getting used to it, you have to forget about the old layout, so it takes even more effort.

Thats why you should teach your kids a human friendly keyboard layout while growing up in order to make their lives easier in the future.
They don't have to struggle like you will the next 3 months learning to write on a new keyboard.
