__tl;dr:__ Check out [this](https://github.com/breuerfelix/feovim) GitHub Repository for an example.  

You may already know that I manage my Neovim with Nix since I wrote [some articles](/blog/nixos-home-manager-neovim) in the past about my current setup.  
Recently, I got really upset about my Neovim startup time. It was too slow ... it is always too slow!  
Nix always loads all plugins at startup. There is a lazy loading feature, but it is not as mature as [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).  
New sidequest unlocked: __Lazy.nvim with plugins managed by Nix.__

No one did it... well at least no one wrote about it.

First, add the lazy.nvim plugin as the only plugin that is managed by Nix and configure it.  
The `# lua` comment is important since it enables Lua syntax highlighting for the string inside a Nix file.

```nix
programs.neovim = {
  # ...
  plugins = [ pkgs.vimPlugins.lazy-nvim ];
  extraLuaConfig =
    # lua
    ''
      require("lazy").setup({
        -- disable all update / install features
        -- this is handled by nix
        rocks = { enabled = false },
        pkg = { enabled = false },
        install = { missing = false },
        change_detection = { enabled = false },
        spec = {
          -- TODO
        },
      })
    '';
};
```

According to the [PluginSpec](https://lazy.folke.io/spec), we can install plugins from a local path with the `dir` parameter. Let's leverage this to manage the plugin source with Nix and lazy loading with lazy.nvim.  
As an example, we will install `nvim-cmp` with all dependencies.

```nix
programs.neovim = {
  # ...
  extraLuaConfig = with pkgs.vimPlugins;
    # lua
    ''
      require("lazy").setup({
        -- ...
        spec = {
          {
            -- since we used `with pkgs.vimPlugins` this will expand to the correct path
            dir = "${nvim-cmp}",
            name = "nvim-cmp",
            event = { "InsertEnter", "CmdlineEnter" },
            dependencies = {
              -- we can also load dependencies from a local folder
              { dir = "${cmp-nvim-lsp}", name = "cmp-nvim-lsp" },
              { dir = "${cmp-path}", name = "cmp-path" },
              { dir = "${cmp-buffer}", name = "cmp-buffer" },
              { dir = "${cmp-cmdline}", name = "cmp-cmdline" },
            },
            config = function ()
              local cmp = require('cmp')

              cmp.setup({
                sources = cmp.config.sources({
                  { name = 'nvim_lsp' },
                  { name = 'path' },
                }),
                snippet = {
                  expand = function(args)
                    vim.snippet.expand(args.body)
                  end,
                },
                mapping = cmp.mapping.preset.insert({}),
              })

              -- Use buffer source for `/` and `?`
              cmp.setup.cmdline({ '/', '?' }, {
                mapping = cmp.mapping.preset.cmdline(),
                sources = {
                  { name = 'buffer' },
                },
              })

              -- Use cmdline & path source for ':'
              cmp.setup.cmdline(':', {
                mapping = cmp.mapping.preset.cmdline(),
                sources = cmp.config.sources({
                  { name = 'path' },
                }, {
                  { name = 'cmdline' },
                }),
                matching = { disallow_symbol_nonprefix_matching = false },
              })
            end,
          },
        },
      })
    '';
};
```

Et voil√†, now you can update your plugins via Nix and lazy load via lazy.nvim.  
I split up the lazy config into different files so my Neovim config stays clean and won't get messy. Just have a look at the repository I linked at the top.
