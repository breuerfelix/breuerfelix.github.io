__TL;DR:__ Run `docker run -d johnktims/folding-at-home` to donate your spare CPU power!

As a software developer, you probably rent some sweet little servers to host all your wonderful, awesome services.  
You probably also realized that there are not that many people using your services, so the server is always running at `0.01` load.  
So what should you do with all that idle compute power? <!--more-->

I stumbled across [folding@home](https://foldingathome.org/), but all the setup guides didn't fit my needs since in a dockerized world I do not want to install anything (except Docker).  
I also found [Boinc](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/), which has native Docker support, but it is a little weird to get started at first.

__Important:__ These programs run as 'low priority' threads. If your other programs need more CPU power, they will get it!

## folding@home

### Docker

A simple one-liner. Works out of the box!

```bash
docker run --restart always --name folding -d -p 7396:7396 johnktims/folding-at-home:latest \
    --user=Anonymous --team=0 --gpu=false --smp=true --power=full

# short version with above as default values
docker run -p 7396:7396 -d johnktims/folding-at-home

# stop and remove
docker stop folding && docker rm folding
```

If you have an account, you can also add the `--passkey=<insert_key>` parameter and change the user.  
There is a neat web UI at `http://localhost:7396` to see what you are currently doing.  
Available `--power` settings are `light`, `medium`, and `full`.  
`--user=Anonymous` and `--team=0` basically mean: help anybody who needs help and do not add credits to an account.

If you have a dedicated graphics card, it is also possible to donate this power! It is way more effective than the CPU.  
You need Docker 19.03+ and `nvidia-docker-toolkit` installed on your host system. Just add the parameter `--gpu all` to your container. Simple as that!

### Windows / Mac

I highly recommend only running this program on a desktop computer or when connected to a power source because it will drain your battery since it is using all the available CPU power on your system.  
You can, of course, also use Docker here, but why not have a nice GUI?

Since this is well documented already, I won't go into detail here.

### Account

If you want to track all the work you did, you can set up an account [here](https://apps.foldingathome.org/getpasskey).  
You will get a passkey and username via email.

### Errors

```
14:43:03:ERROR:WU00:FS00:Exception: Could not get an assignment
```

If you see this 'error' log, don't worry, there is just nothing to do right now. It will try again later and maybe pick up some work!  
That means there are a lot of people donating right now. Keep it up!

## Boinc

First, you have to pick a project. One client can only participate in one project at a given time.  
[Click here](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/projects.php) for a list of all projects.

I picked [Rosetta@home](http://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/) for this guide because they are currently working on COVID-19.

First, you have to create an account at the [Rosetta Project Page](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/create_account_form.php).  
Once you are logged in, go to the section `Account Information` and click on `show` to see the `Account key`.  
At the bottom, you will see a `weak account key`. Grab this one, we need it!

### Docker

```bash
# run
docker run --restart always -d --name boinc --net=host --pid=host \
    -e BOINC_CMD_LINE_OPTIONS="--attach_project http://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/ <weak_account_key>" boinc/client

# stop and remove
docker stop boinc && docker rm boinc
```

If you want to support another project, just swap the project URL with the new account key and you are good to go.  
If you need more configuration, just have a look [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/boinc/client) to connect a remote GUI RPC.

### Desktop

[Click here](http://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/join.php) to set up the desktop version or even an Android app.

### Errors

```
No protocol specified
```

If this is spammed in the Docker logs... don't worry about it! It is just a warning.  
I still have to figure out how to suppress this.
