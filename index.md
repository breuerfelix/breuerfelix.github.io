I am a 25 years old [Software Engineering Student](https://www.th-koeln.de) living in Cologne, Germany.

After finishing my apprenticeship in Mechatronics at [Schwarze-Robitec](https://www.schwarze-robitec.com), 
I spend some time working as a Software Engineer in different companies. 
Currently I work as a DevOps Engineer at [inovex](https://www.inovex.de) while studying.

Trying out new technologies is one thing I love the most doing in my spare time.  
I also enjoy solving difficult boulder problems and strumming the guitar.  
If you are not already doing, try it out yourself! It's worth it :)

Now take a step back, relax and have fun reading!
