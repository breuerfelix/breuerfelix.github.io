I am a 25 years old [Software Engineering Student](https://www.th-koeln.de) living in Cologne, Germany.

After finishing my apprenticeship in Mechatronics at [Schwarze-Robitec](https://www.schwarze-robitec.com), I spend some time working as a Software Engineer in companies like [Richrath-Elektronik](http://www.richrath-elektronik.de) and [GipfelstÃ¼rmer-Kommunikation](https://www.gipfelstuermer-kommunikation.com) while studying.

Trying out new technologies is one thing I love the most doing in my spare time.  
I also enjoy solving difficult boulder problems and strumming the guitar.  
If you are not already doing, try it out yourself! It's worth it :)
