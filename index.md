I am Felix, a **Cloud Platform Engineer** living in Cologne _(Germany)_ and born 1994 in Aachen.

After finishing my apprenticeship in Mechatronics at [Schwarze Robitec](https://www.schwarze-robitec.com),
I spend some time working as a Software Developer in different companies while studying Computer Science at the [University of Cologne](https://www.th-koeln.de).
Currently I enjoy working fulltime as a Cloud Platform Engineer at [inovex](https://www.inovex.de/en).

Trying out new technologies is one thing I love the most doing in my spare time.  
I also enjoy solving difficult boulder problems and strumming the guitar.  
If you are not already doing, try it out yourself! It's worth it :)

Now take a step back, relax and have fun exploring!
