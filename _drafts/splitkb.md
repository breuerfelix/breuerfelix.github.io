TLDR; An alpinist does not climb the Mount Everest in sneakers. Why should you?

## Optimised for the Operator (aka. YOU)

Did you ever wonder why the keyboard layout is staggered?
It is because old mechanical typing machines couldn't be constructed with a matrix layout like most of the split keyboards have.
prompt: write something about the history of keyboard layouts and why a matrix split keyboard layout is more ergonomic

## Your thumb is bored

One key for two fingers? What the f* is this sh*? Your index finger should handle 6 keys but the thumb only 0.5 keys ... I don't know about this weird keyboard design.  
A split keyboard has at least one or two seperate keys per thumb. I mapped backspace, enter and a layer switch to these additional keys.  
I finally found a purpose for my thumbs (which are actually the strongest fingers on the hand)!

## You are a beast and you know it

The more muscular you become, the harder it gets to keep your hands tight together on your keyboard (for sure I don't have these kind of problems since I am a programmer.... but anyways).  
Standard keyboards generate shoulder, back and wrist pain over the years. You always have to squeeze your shoulders in front of your body together, which is not a healthy position to be in for a long period of time.  

## You want kids...

... and you want them to life in a better world, I am sure!  
"But Felix, if split keyboards are so nice, why haven't I seen them on any desk so far?"  
Good question, for sure. Learning to write on a keyboard is not as easy as you might think because you learned it as a kid or over the years. It is a slow process because it is difficult.  
Reprogramming your brain to a new keyboard or keyboard layout is even more difficult since before getting used to it, you have to forget about the old layout, so it takes even more effort.

Thats why you should teach your kids a human friendly keyboard layout while growing up in order to make their lives easier in the future.
They don't have to struggle like you will the next 3 months learning to write on a new keyboard.
