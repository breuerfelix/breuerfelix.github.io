tldr; an alpinist does not climb the mount everest in sneakers

1. standard keyboards are optimised for the machine not for the operator
2. your thumb is bored
3. your keyboard is not designed for a beast like you
- breite schultern!!
4. you want your kids to live in a better world
- better teach them a human friendly keyboard layout from the early on
- its like multi lingual kids
