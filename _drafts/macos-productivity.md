## introduction

explain what a power user is
power users often use linux because of its customizability

in this post i wanna share some of the applications i use to enhance my workflow
i wont go into detail about my terminal because this is a another big story i wanna cover in a different post

## application launcher

briefly explain what application launchers are

- raycast
- briefly explain what raycast is

explain what can be done with raycast quicklinks

raycast has multiple plugins that can be installed via the raycast store
some examples i use really often:
- bitwaren (password manager)
- github / gitlab
- clipboard history

## tiling window manager

- briefly explain what a window manager is and what tiling means

there are 2 out there for macos:
- yabai
- amethyst

i use yabai since the github repo has more drive

you can set rules with yabai so that it does not manage dialog windows or system settings
give an example to this

## keybindings

- karabiner elements
- skhd

i set all my yabai keybindings with skhd since it makes it easy to bind shell commands
give an example on how to bind a yabai command with skhd

complex keybindings are done with karabiner elements like "ctrl is command and ctrl is ctrl while in the terminal"
give an example on how to set a karabiner elements via json

karabiner event viewer is pretty good for debugging keyboard and mouse input

## browser

there are some browsers that are used by power users like vivaldi and arc
they allow users to rebind every shortcut unlike chrome or firefox
both are chromium based so you can install all chrome browser extensions
they are the only browsers that allow native vertical tab layout

there is a chromium plugin called vimium which lets you navigate the web via shortcuts, pressing f will highlight every clickable link on the current site and mark them with a keystroke like "gh", if you press "gh" it will then click this link for you

## vim

i personally use neovim for my development but that has a steep learning curve and you really need to want this.
better start of with installing a vim plugin for the editor you currently use and get used to it slowly.
you dont have to fully commit to coding in the terminal, even though it looks badass and you are a king when pair programming but it wont make you a fast or better programmer. IDEs like intelliJ are really good and offer a really good bundle. vim is only for people that really want to take time and configure their IDE as their needs.

## homebrew

briefly explain homebrew
i use it to install nearly all of my tools in order to track what i have installed on my system and to uninstall them easily
also you can export a list of all installed brews in order to ease setting up a new mac

## other useful tools

- meeting bar
  - it displays upcoming meetings in your macos status bar so you never miss them even though you are in the zone
- sketchybar
  - alternative macos status bar (looks fancy but does not increase productivity at all)
- timeout
  - blurs your screen every x minutes for some seconds to release strain on your eyes
  - it is not good to look at the same distance for ours
  - try to look outside the window during this short break

## dont freak out

sometimes it is also good to just lay back and enjoy browsing or coding. there is no need to be a power user 24/7.
i personally have my power user hours where i got an idea and i wanna dump my brain farts as fast as possible into bad code and that has to be as fast and efficient as possible since these hours usually dont last long for me that is why i have to use them!
